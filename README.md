## Graducation Tracker

This is a stupid project, You may ask why because people ask me a lot that how many semester do you have to complete your graduation or my friends ask "Ay, How many credit did you complete?", I ended up like "I don't know `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`" because I don't track my records and can't remember at the time.

So, this stupid idea pop up in my mind, It's a pretty simple application if you can request for features or can create [Issue](https://github.com/rudSarkar/graducation_tracker/issues)/[Pull Request](https://github.com/rudSarkar/graducation_tracker/pulls) to improve it.


Long story short this only works for [Green Univeristy of Bangladesh](https://green.edu.bd/).

#### How to use in your local machine

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install virtualenv

$ python3 app.py
```

#### If you have Docker

```
$ chmod +x build.sh
$ sudo ./build.sh
